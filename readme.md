# Kinds of Consultations

This is a slide deck created using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), but it's also a guide through our workflow for project development. The tools and techniques listed here are mostly for digital projects, but the resources might be applied to all kinds of projects for all kinds of projects. You'll notice that we include [the research help desk](https://www.wooster.edu/academics/libraries/contact/ask/) and [the writing center](https://www.wooster.edu/academics/apex/academics/writing/.); that's because all projects _start with research_ and all projects can benefit from _carefully considered structure_. 

Consultations will help you do the work better. They will not necessarily help you do the work faster. Sometimes what you find out is that your idea might take you through a few extra hoops than you'd anticipated. You can't just show up to the recording studio, sit down for 30 minutes, and expect to leave with bottled magic. It takes planning, practice, and respect for the process. Give yourself some time. Seek help early. 

### Project Consultations.
**_"I've got a project idea, now what?"_** Sometimes you have an assignment or an idea and you need some help figuring out how to go about doing it all. Have you considered learning more about: 
  * scripting 
  * storyboarding 
  * editing video
  * editing audio
  * one-button studio orientation
  * sound studio orientation
  * narrowing the topic
  * finding open-access resources
  
### Product Consultations. 
**_"I want to learn iMovie. Who can help?"_** The short answer is that Student Technology Assistants (STAs) are at the Digital Media Bar, and CoRE Consultants are floating around the library most days. If you stop by the Digital Media Bar or the Digital Studio, you're likely to find someone who can give you a hand. (They'll be wearing a nametag.) If you prefer to schedule consults, you can do that too. Find your expert.


### Process Consultations.
**_"How do I find out more about larger topics, like "digital mapping"?_** Maybe you've heard a few things about timelines, or geospatial visualizations, or digital publishing. Maybe you'd like to know a little more. You should reach out using whatever venue makes sense to you -- the Libraries, the Writing Center, CoRE, STAs -- and we'll make sure that the right person gets in touch with you.
